# [Active Record Lite]

A hand rolled implementation of the Rails library gem Active Record

## Goal

The goal of this project was to develop a simplified, lightweight version of the Rails library gem Active Record. I built Active Record Lite from the ground up using metaprogramming techniques and adding key functionality from the original gem. These functionalities include:
-SQL objects
-"Where" searches
-Object relationships

## Implementation Details
